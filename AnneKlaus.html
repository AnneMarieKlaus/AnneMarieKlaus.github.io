	<h1>Anne Marie Klaus</h1>
	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>I am a warrior goddess shifting the earth one mom-moment at a time as well as through well-timed wifely interventions, food that heals, and PROGRAMMING that DOES GOOD.</p>  Born in So. Cal. and raising my family in Charlotte, NC.  I deepen my world through a minimalist lifestyle that lends itself to Nomadic Paradise.

	<h2>While We Were Nomads</h2>
	<p>My husband and I gave up our oversized house, gave AWAY all of the THINGS that were clogging our life, and set out on an epic trip with our 3 year old daughter.  My daughter loved, loved, loved her Montessori school at the time.  So to coax her through the change, we explained that we would be in "Travel School."  In 8 months we had the following adventures:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Learn how to live out of a friend's house as a family for a month.</li>
		<li>Live in an RV for almost 2 months while exploring San Diego to Vancouver.</li>
		<li>Open our hearts outgrageously to Synchronicity...what a bless-ed flow!</li>
		<li>Family Reunions, Collge Reunions, High School Reunions, and dear friend reunions.</li>
		<li>Get up close and personal with the powerful force of glaciers on a cruise to Alaska and a helicopter ride in the Canadian Rockies.</li>
		<li>Initiate a baby boy to join our family. ;) </li>
		<li>Live in Germany! for 3 months, learning the language along side my daughter.</li>
		<li>Live near Vienna, Austria for another month and a half, and spend our first Christmas with my German mother-in-law.</li>	
		<li>Soul search, soul search, soul search.</li>
		<li>And then, once back in Charlotte, HOME search, HOME search, HOME search.</li>
		<li>Realize Coding and Programming fit right into this blessed life of ours.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>My Languages</h2>
	<p>I love languages.  In addition to English, I've spoken Spanish, French and German. I've written Latin and a bit of Japanese.  And it is the most natural and beloved undertaking to learn PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES as well.  In addition to HTTP and CSS, I work with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ruby, and</li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
	</ul>
